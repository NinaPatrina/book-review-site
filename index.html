      <p>It's easy to write correct Ruby code, but to gain the fluency needed to write great Ruby code, you must go beyond syntax and absorb the "Ruby way" of thinking and problem solving. In Eloquent Ruby, Russ Olsen helps you write Ruby like true Rubyists do-so you can leverage its immense, surprising power. Olsen draws on years of experience internalizing the Ruby culture and teaching Ruby to other programmers. He guides you to the "Ah Ha!" moments when it suddenly becomes clear why Ruby works the way it does, and how you can take advantage of this language's elegance and expressiveness. Eloquent Ruby starts small, answering tactical questions focused on a single statement, method, test, or bug. You'll learn how to write code that actually looks like Ruby (not Java or C#); why Ruby has so many control structures; how to use strings, expressions, and symbols; and what dynamic typing is really good for. Next, the book addresses bigger questions related to building methods and classes. You'll discover why Ruby classes contain so many tiny methods, when to use operator overloading, and when to avoid it. Olsen explains how to write Ruby code that writes its own code-and why you'll want to. He concludes with powerful project-level features and techniques ranging from gems to Domain Specific Languages. A part of the renowned Addison-Wesley Professional Ruby Series, Eloquent Ruby will help you "put on your Ruby-colored glasses" and get results that make you a true believer.

      <img src="images/cover-confident_ruby.jpg"/>
      <p>For many programmers, discovering Ruby is a revelation. They are overjoyed by how elegantly and succinctly they can state problems in the language. But then the real world creeps in, and that joy gradually wanes as the code becomes cluttered with distracting edge case scenarios, error handling, and checks for nil.

      <p>The reference for writing fantastic Rails applications

        You build web applications, and you love Ruby on Rails because it provides a framework for developing applications that are are fast, fun, and easy to change. Over time these applications can become bloated, development slows down, and changes to the codebase become painful.
        
        This book was written to help you learn to detect emerging problems in your codebase; we'll deliver the solutions for fixing them, and maintaining an application that will be fun to work on for years to come.
        
        In addition to the book (in HTML, PDF, EPUB, and Kindle formats), you also get a complete example application, and the ability to get your questions about Ruby on Rails answered by the thoughtbot team.
        
        The book is written using Markdown and pandoc and distributed via GitHub. When you purchase, we give you access directly to the repository, so you can use the GitHub comment and issue features to give us feedback about what we've written and what you'd like to see. Give us your toughest Ruby questions with GitHub issues, and we'll answer. Last but not least, also included is a Ruby on Rails reference application. What the book describes and explains, the example app demonstrates with real, working code. Fully up to date for Rails 3.2.
